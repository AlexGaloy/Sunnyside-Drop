# Sunnyside-Drop
A short game I made for a 2-hour game jam that I've fixed up to be presentable. It's a 2d (sorta puzzle) platformer about you, an egg, dropping onto frying pans.

## How To Play
Arrow keys or WASD to move, space to jump, and r to go back to the dozen if you get stuck. Jump onto the pans from high enough up to crack your shell and fry yourself. Do it as each egg in the dozen for all 12 pans to win.
